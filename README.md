## Data Wrangling Tutorial

In this data wrangling tutorial, we will show you a few basic functions to help you wrangle data in R! For this tutorial we will be using a dataset about spotify music.

### Check out the dataset!

*The dataset was made available by Charlie Thompson, Josiah Parry, Donal Phipps, and Tom Wolff who authored the spotifyr package as well as Kaylin Pavlik who had a recent blogpost using the audio features to explore and classify songs. She used the spotifyr package to collect about 5000 songs from 6 main categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rap, & Rock).*

More information about the dataset can be found here: [TidyTuesday: Spotify Songs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md).

Feel free to click the link above and view the data dictionary which breaks down the attributes in spotify_songs (e.g. track_name, playlist_genre, energy).
